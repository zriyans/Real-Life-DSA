1. Suppose we are coding a chess-playing algorithm and at a certain point, the algorithm finds that a set of steps fails to win. In this situation, the algorithm will reverse back to the safe state and try another possible set of steps.
2. Sudoku solver
3. 2048 game

MISC:
1. Binary search can be used in negotiations.
If the seller has a price in mind but does not reveal it, you can name a low bid, to which the seller will respond with a high ask price. You can then raise your bid, and the seller can lower her asking price. Since each of you has an ideal price in mind, the named bids and asks can be roughly halfway toward the price desirable by each side. This is not exactly the binary search algorithm, but very much in the spirit of binary search.
2. Hashmap has its internal implementation in the AVL tree.
